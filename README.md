# The @door7302's Blog

This is my new place for blogging. My old blog is still alive: http://junosandme.over-blog.com/ to keep old posts available. 
The aim of this new blog is to talk and share all about networking's stuff  (**netdevops**), often around Junos but not only this time. Indeed, I could write about a specific technology, "Automation", or also around Nokia SROS. The posts will be shorter than I have done in the past and blog's topics will most often deal with technologies or projects on which I work. 

Hope you will like this new blog's version! And as usual be indulgent with my english :) 

## Junos Inline Monitoring

Junos Inline monitoring, aka. IMON, is a cool feature that tries to leverage the best things of other “sampling” technologies (Mirroring, sFlow, IPFIX) to build a flexible and scalable monitoring solution.
