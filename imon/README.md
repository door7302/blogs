# Junos Inline Monitoring

Junos Inline monitoring, aka. IMON, is a cool feature that tries to leverage the best things of other “sampling” technologies (Mirroring, sFlow, IPFIX) to build a flexible and scalable monitoring solution.

It relies on IPFIX (datalinkframesection) to convey Raw Packets with additional metadata. 

During the 7th [vNOG](https://virtualnog.net) event I shared my tests of the Junos IMON feature.
